        transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also
        change the text after it was created.\\r\\nSean Devine: In my side, mostly
        worked on profit related things made pretty good progress in a couple of key
        areas. main thing I worked on today related to that was\\r\\nSean Devine:
        \ Sort of building a structure at the Project estimate, set level that consolidated
        all of the effective estimate. amounts, which I didn&#39;t really think through
        before today and took a little bit of time, but I think that the shape of
        it&#39;s about, right, reviewed with Milan, his progress on The, the functionality
        and that seems to be going pretty well. We&#39;ve got a demo with Gallagher
        on our current progress on Monday, and we&#39;re focused on making sure that
        we do a pretty good job for that. I still think we&#39;re about a few weeks
        behind, but\\r\\nSean Devine:  chugging along. So that&#39;s that. I think
        you may have seen the last night. I took the new check EBT API that they released
        and swapped it out for the Hey Kayla answer API.\\r\\nSean Devine: The answers
        are remarkably good now. I mean. They&#39;re almost all eights or above, I&#39;d
        say. And the only time really it misses is if there&#39;s just a total lack
        of content or if the question is going to say way too broad. But For the most
        part it it writes answers as well as a person would do if they had a bunch
        of time.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Benjamin. You looked at some of them today. Did
        you find the same?\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: And they seem much more chatty.
        And personal. And in a few cases,…\\r\\nSean Devine:  Yeah.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer: I thought they gave better. Not answers.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Yeah,
        I agree with that too. yeah, the nice thing is, I mean, before we had this
        tension where if we, like let out the slack more and allowed it to talk, it
        would give like Nice sounding answers but they&#39;d be wrong too. Often And
        then we tightened it up and the answers were shorter. Which meant that they
        were, they were not all that wrong. And usually, they were right. But they
        didn&#39;t say as much as ideally they would say now. It seems to get that,
        right? It says more. If there&#39;s more to say it says less, if there&#39;s
        less to say it handles situations where it doesn&#39;t. Want to answer pretty
        well. So all together, really pretty great really, really pleased with it.\\r\\nSean
        Devine:  I&#39;ll pour it over the others. I don&#39;t know if anyone saw
        what I did, and I didn&#39;t document it on the client, but basically I made
        it so that if in a prompter, you edit, the prompt content to be the, the new
        JSON structure that the Chat GPT messages API expects, It&#39;ll just work.
        So you can do it like the old way, where you just have a plain text prompt
        or you can write it as a JSON file and in the format that&#39;s expected.
        Basically, it tries to parse the the prompter, into JSON, if it fails it just
        passes through the text as it&#39;s and that seems pretty fine. So anyways,
        I did that last night. I&#39;ve got, I&#39;ve got to do the rest of the prompts
        and fidget it with it, but I mean, for the most part I think it&#39;s in great
        shape.\\r\\nSean Devine: I think that&#39;s about it. Those are my two focus
        areas are really. My one main one with profit with just a little diversion
        last night.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Yeah, Cleanser you want to go?\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino: Okay. And not much to talk about. I haven&#39;t made any progress
        on push notifications yet. Hoping to make it today, and Coming Monday.\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino:  So there was this bug that Was throwing a script arrow and roll
        bar. It was very annoying. I thought I got all of it on yesterday. By adding
        a card. So the error is being thrown by the JavaScript Google Maps API. And
        it throws when it throws that arrow. If we have Open Info window, it&#39;s
        called. It&#39;s like when you click on a map marker and it shows the and
        it shows the notification of the, if you, if that notification is open, and
        if you change between routes, Then it throws that error. It&#39;s something
        you do with destroying of the view and removing of the listeners at the same
        time, some kind of a race condition. The\\r\\n00:05:00\\r\\nColenso Castellino:
        \ So I try to handle that by using Good Old is Route. Active Flag seem to
        work in the first case that we had caught. But on the plan page, if you go
        if you open up the plan page right now and if you go back to the lens list
        page, Then it still shows that error. I mean it is not exactly a big issue
        but it&#39;s annoying. It&#39;s crowding up role at the moment it Just annoying
        and it has happened recently, I not sure. Exactly. What is throwing it. I
        don&#39;t even think that it&#39;s anything. I said that. That was changed.
        I think it&#39;s probably some Google API or something changed from it externally
        and it&#39;s running error. I&#39;ll see what the problem is today. And\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino:  See if there&#39;s some other way to fix it. That was one thing
        you see.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: My plus one there is that I&#39;m a big
        fan of making alerts worth looking at.\\r\\nSean Devine: I…\\r\\nColenso Castellino:
        \ Yes.\\r\\nSean Devine: like, there were some reports from listener or listeners
        from users that This is causing trouble at least on that time card screen,
        right?\\r\\nColenso Castellino: It was causing actual trouble. When?\\r\\nSean
        Devine: But I mean, maybe it was coincidental but It seems like error. It
        seemed like, I don&#39;t know, three days ago. There were reports that trouble
        on a time card screen also was the screen.\\r\\nColenso Castellino: Yes. So
        at least on a time card screen,…\\r\\nSean Devine: This was coming from Or
        one of.\\r\\nColenso Castellino: this error has been fixed by my patch. That.
        Okay. What is on the Landscene is still happening? So, And look at that today.\\r\\nSean
        Devine: But ideally we&#39;d have a bit more of a sort of bulletproof. Way
        to wrap it that no matter what&#39;s fine. So I mean We don&#39;t spend more
        time in it,…\\r\\nColenso Castellino: Yeah.\\r\\nSean Devine: but if you could
        find that, that&#39;d be good.\\r\\nColenso Castellino:  Yes, I know that
        today. so, I also Worked on the page title Lender. With Amber Template. I
        completed it. Then we found. So initial, I understand to check the results
        of the\\r\\nColenso Castellino:  Of the Linter and it, there were some false
        positives, wherein the page title was present on the parent. There was not
        present on a child, something like that of, that sort. Then I have to tweak
        the paste, title intern a little bit, did that? Now, it&#39;s funny. She&#39;s
        Call. But there are considerable number of pages where. Okay, so how many,
        how many pages do we need to fix a base title for they remember?\\r\\nSean
        Devine: Okay.\\r\\nAnish Gadekar: Damn you. Not exactly, sure. Like it.\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino:  Okay, definitely I think more than 100, at least.\\r\\nAnish
        Gadekar:  Yeah, it was around 200 something 214 or 84 million.\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino: Okay. So at least the routes. I mean around slash templates are
        highlighted. By the lender. So that seems to be working, okay? Anish will
        finish that work up by. Adding the paste titles in the places that I highlighted.
        For now I&#39;m just made it to spit up a warning instead of an error. And
        after Anish finishes his book, once we have page titles and all of these,
        I let it pages, then I&#39;ll change it to an error. So next time whoever,
        it&#39;s a new route, make sure that you had a page title for it.\\r\\nPankaj
        Kataria: And justice addition. Should we try to handle the pace title via
        application? HbS or like, The most parent route authenticated address, maybe.\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino: Handle in the sense validate him in with this present, or this
        add some thing.\\r\\nPankaj Kataria:  I mean. um, this should all be happening
        at one place instead of different templates.\\r\\nColenso Castellino: You.
        Each page has its own title.\\r\\nSean Devine: Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean
        kind of\\r\\nSean Devine:  because it will, then it doesn&#39;t have the data
        until it&#39;s down there, you don&#39;t, I mean,\\r\\nColenso Castellino:
        Like, for example, meeting id. So and so plan ID,…\\r\\nSean Devine: yeah,
        name of the plan idea or…\\r\\nColenso Castellino: so and so\\r\\nSean Devine:
        the plan ID, So we don&#39;t, we don&#39;t know, until the ultimate childhood
        is rendered.\\r\\n00:10:00\\r\\nColenso Castellino:  route.\\r\\nSean Devine:
        What the context is,\\r\\nPankaj Kataria: If?\\r\\nColenso Castellino:  I
        mean, there is a page title service that we could use but like Sean said and
        unless we have the data, we don&#39;t always have the right page start to\\r\\nPankaj
        Kataria: Okay.\\r\\nColenso Castellino:  Yeah, that&#39;s it. From my side.\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino: Pankaj, was next.\\r\\nSean Devine: Here.\\r\\nColenso Castellino:
        \ Now, I was thinking of making Pankaj the captains. He was the first one
        called today.\\r\\nPankaj Kataria: So, I&#39;m continuing on the\\r\\nPankaj
        Kataria:  Board bulk assign form handling more. And real world scenarios over
        here. One of them was Like, and Allowing the option to, you know, retain.\\r\\nSean
        Devine: You.\\r\\nPankaj Kataria:  Time zone, existing requirements. When
        there is similar, resource assigned or similar resource classification, assign
        So I read this setting to the form. On.\\r\\nPankaj Kataria:  and, This isn&#39;t
        shipped yet. I need some\\r\\nPankaj Kataria: Style corrections on this soil.
        Ship it today.\\r\\nSean Devine: Here. That&#39;s a good feature.\\r\\nPankaj
        Kataria: I&#39;m working to.\\r\\nPankaj Kataria:  Assign bulk. I mean, crew
        templates. Where this form? So that will come next.\\r\\nSean Devine: Yes.\\r\\nPankaj
        Kataria:  and that from,\\r\\nSean Devine:  oh, Benjamin.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        Hello, okay. so database connection issue in terms of it, I Haven&#39;t having
        a really hard time with Heroku. Getting good support on this. Current state
        is everything that they have documented or done is a mess. And I have no plans
        on making any more work in this area until I get better support for them,
        right? Just probably Being very pushy is my goal right now. I just don&#39;t
        understand. Um, In terms of the casting issues, we&#39;ve had, they seem to
        be resolved by switching the cash store that we use.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        \ We have some backfills to do with regards to shift percent tracking. I broke
        a scope in a refactor and accident. Where it was, you&#39;re able to get the
        driver movement, but it wouldn&#39;t update it in certain cases, and I made
        it never updated. I&#39;ve added a regression test for that. I have not looked
        into what the work is needed to backfill it. I don&#39;t know.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  And it should be difficult.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  I, i don&#39;t,
        I had a question for Colenso about, Plans and getting the FCM push token work
        into production and on the native apps. If that is, Something that I should
        keep on my mind to. I don&#39;t the other one is about There&#39;s an issue
        of scientific answer right now that I put in the meeting chat, I&#39;m in
        different to who it actually is works on it. But OMG would like to start using
        the feature that I worked on to have a default customer in agreement. Um,
        being copied, when new customers are create. when you customers are created,
        having the rate of grant be copied, From the, from the specified one. I don&#39;t
        know. It probably requires a little bit of UI consideration, but actually
        interface. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too complicated.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        \ And it&#39;s too much for me at least. So I don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible
        for it.\\r\\n00:15:00\\r\\nColenso Castellino: I&#39;ll look at it. I need
        help us all else.\\r&quot;\"}]}"

        Fleischer: Okay. Yeah, I just if you can just even triage and delegate and…\\r\\nColenso
        Castellino:  Yeah.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: as long as someone has a hedgehog,
        I just want to make sure that it&#39;s not lost. There&#39;s an interesting
        issue that&#39;s come up with those zynga with regard to split loads when
        a material when there&#39;s more on material transaction on the same trip.
        That, although we handle the financials correctly on the time card level because
        material transaction exports in the invoice, exports is to some extent to
        hack. I was incorrectly specifying the load that the quantity for every material
        transaction by load is one. and I added some logic today to handle that that
        if there&#39;s the quantity per load, is one divided by the number of loads
        on the trip. So there&#39;s now a Attribute on the material transaction in
        on the server and and the invoice data. Which is a trip load count. Essentially.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  Um, there&#39;s an open integration issue right now, with Palmer
        Peckham. Which I think would be have good to have some discussion. Doesn&#39;t,
        I don&#39;t, I know time is precious on this call, so, I&#39;ll just mention
        that the complicated issues that because Pac-Man and Palmer are the same customer
        with the same tech team with two branches. Um, they&#39;ve done the worker
        planning on doing the work to have the one integration endpoint. Return data
        for both branches. And I&#39;m of two minds about that because it makes it
        simple. On the one hand to have one importer that Talks to two branches and
        maybe that&#39;s a behavior tractor. But on the other hand, it&#39;s like
        totally different for everything else and I think it could cause other trouble.
        And just the sort of the confusion about which branch it is. I don&#39;t.\\r\\nSean
        Devine: Hmm, where do you link them? Do you lean towards just having Identical
        separate ones, then.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Yes. I mean, it&#39;s Having.
        Yeah, that that&#39;s certainly the the way things normally work, but I don&#39;t
        know if that&#39;s confusing to them. Like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t just because
        it&#39;s confusing to me, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s confusing to them like\\r\\nSean
        Devine: I think I&#39;d leaned that way.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  I mean
        because like Kayla or Jim asked Kayla, I do you plan on using the same parameters.
        For this, we&#39;ll just add the sites like I so I don&#39;t know. So I don&#39;t,
        I don&#39;t know. Who is the domain expert on the like, are they, are they
        so similar that we that it&#39;s in our interest to like, we&#39;ll be fighting
        the fighting the stream to treat them as\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  Different
        in this place.\\r\\nSean Devine: I mean. I don&#39;t know. It seems like\\r\\nSean
        Devine:  It&#39;s it seems like I&#39;d go with, I mean, if we always if we
        never have the same importer work across branches, that I don&#39;t know that
        I&#39;d start now.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Okay good. Other open issue. Is
        there&#39;s an open discussion right now at the Palmer. Export that Kalan
        air working on. That&#39;s I think I&#39;ve taken a while to respond to that
        but I think otherwise it&#39;s going well. Same with other various integrations,
        too many dimension. I have one release note pending right now.\\r\\nSean Devine:
        You are.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: I put in the release notes channel because
        they need some help words within it. I think I wrote a terrible release note.
        I think honestly like, I think I covered what I wanted to cover, and I, I
        just If any of you feel like, You want to give it a second look? It&#39;s
        around a feature that I shipped today. That was they come up a few times as
        feature bug, fix, whatever is that I shipped the idea of a job production
        plan. Is flexible and not complete. I would disallow post invoicing changes
        for a number of things. And that has caused trouble for job production plans
        that are still running because they&#39;re they have flexible shifts on them.
        And I wanted to use that as opportunity to also talk about.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  Why we have these validations and I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t
        order things, right, or structure, right?\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: So, anyone
        looks at them,…\\r\\nSean Devine: Here. Okay,…\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: tells
        me how they use Chat Gpd to fix it up and be happy to.\\r\\n00:20:00\\r\\nSean
        Devine: exactly. In doing so now,\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  Yeah, I have another
        release date. I&#39;m going to write after that. One about adding Support
        for accounting for materials, like vendor IDs. And I&#39;m, which is also,
        I think gonna be the same kind of release network. It&#39;s A, If you are
        interested at here&#39;s a thing.\\r\\nSean Devine: Here.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        \ And I guess I should probably also write one about split loads.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  Because that&#39;s also something that often we talked about much
        but it&#39;s very interesting.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  That&#39;s yeah,
        I know I just talked for a while and I&#39;m done. It&#39;s hard to believe.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  My gosh.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar: I&#39;ll give my update. Of. So,
        last two days, I&#39;ve mostly been working on some bugs and quickies and
        small improvements and stuff. I was supposed to start work on vision importer
        for treatment location events, but I haven&#39;t started with that. Also,
        I was supposed to find a good vector database hosted one, but\\r\\nShirish
        Parsekar:  As I said, I didn&#39;t do anything on that last two days. So I&#39;ll
        continue work on that today.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar:  That&#39;s it. That&#39;s
        all I have.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Naiya.\\r\\nNaiya Shah: Yes, my update. I&#39;m
        able to complete the time card approval notification thing, but now I&#39;m
        working on the settings to opt out of the time card of pool notification.
        So for that user label and organization settings are done, I&#39;ll currently
        I&#39;m working on the job presentation, plan related settings on it. Um,
        yes. And then after I will look into the My ongoing PR for segment description
        filter in which I have to apply the fuzzy scope. Instagram, the current whatever.
        Yes. That&#39;s it.\\r\\nSean Devine: Okay, great. Hey Shirish. Hey Shirish.
        And and this may apply to Naiya too, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve taken
        a look into that and benjaminson with you.\\r\\nSean Devine:  The caching,
        the query related to the Lane summary. I think it&#39;s called the cycle time
        summary. Resource. I don&#39;t remember exactly. I even looked at it since
        I spiked it back when and it&#39;d be really great if we could speed that
        up, I&#39;m not sure. I haven&#39;t really assessed how much work it being\\r\\nShirish
        Parsekar: Yes, I made some adjustment to the query. I used the material transaction,
        turn it somewhere was possible, and the performance is good. Now. so,…\\r\\nSean
        Devine:  oh,\\r\\nShirish Parsekar: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s, I mean, I
        don&#39;t think we need to cash it urgently for now.\\r\\nSean Devine:  oh,
        that&#39;s good news. I didn&#39;t realize.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar:  Yes, well
        previously it was taking like six to seven seconds. Around like this time
        of the day, but that has come down to less than one second.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar:
        \ That&#39;s a good improvement, I think.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Oh yeah. Yeah,
        I&#39;m I mean I know that they were like year-to-date. It was timing out
        the other day.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar:  Okay.\\r\\nSean Devine:  Yeah. Well,
        but I mean maybe that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s fixed. Now I&#39;m just running
        it right now.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar: Yeah, I haven&#39;t tried out. Inside
        right out yesterday.\\r\\nSean Devine:  yeah yeah I just ran the year today
        on Geiger the first time it seems like maybe there&#39;s like a like a database
        cash warming kind of thing that first time I ran it was a little slow and
        then started to go Quick after that and click about a minute and or a second
        and a half for year to date. That&#39;s great there. If you don&#39;t mind
        post back to the that thread. So that because Matt&#39;s been bugging about
        that forever. Need to appreciate that.\\r\\nShirish Parsekar: Yeah, I think
        I did reply to that.\\r\\nSean Devine: Just meet.\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        I thought he did too, but it might have been like one of those dual threads
        thing where, like, Dev was crossing from somewhere else and sometimes happens.\\r\\nSean
        Devine:  Yeah, maybe I just wasn&#39;t paying attention.\\r\\nSean Devine:
        \ All right. Well, thanks for\\r\\n00:25:00\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Yes,
        Siris found that like he looked, he picked it up, he looked at it, he had
        an idea and I think I&#39;m gonna say was maybe an hour of work with a They
        looked at that was pretty good attention to turn around.\\r\\nSean Devine:
        \ yeah, that&#39;s super\\r\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  and also on the jump job
        director playing driver movement, one although I ended up Finishing the PR.
        He started. He found actual problem. So also, like lots of credit to shirishan.\\r\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer: An eye on, like customer facing issues. And Getting to their cause.\\r\\nSean

        a business unit filter on the time card. And now I&#39;ll continue working
        on the page titles. After that, I&#39;ll see if you assign it.\\r\\nSean Devine:

        three days Mill and I will have some pretty good success on the profit stuff
