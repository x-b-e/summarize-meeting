        Kataria&#39;s Presentation, Sean Devine, Shirish Parsekar\\r\\n\\nTranscript\\r\\n\\nThis
        editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People
        can also change the text after it was created.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: In my
        side, mostly worked on profit related things made pretty good progress in
        a couple of key areas. main thing I worked on today related to that was\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  Sort of building a structure at the Project estimate, set level that
        consolidated all of the effective estimate. amounts, which I didn&#39;t really
        think through before today and took a little bit of time, but I think that
        the shape of it&#39;s about, right, reviewed with Milan, his progress on The,
        the functionality and that seems to be going pretty well. We&#39;ve got a
        demo with Gallagher on our current progress on Monday, and we&#39;re focused
        on making sure that we do a pretty good job for that. I still think we&#39;re
        about a few weeks behind, but\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  chugging along. So that&#39;s
        that. I think you may have seen the last night. I took the new check EBT API
        that they released and swapped it out for the Hey Kayla answer API.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: The answers are remarkably good now. I mean. They&#39;re almost all
        eights or above, I&#39;d say. And the only time really it misses is if there&#39;s
        just a total lack of content or if the question is going to say way too broad.
        But For the most part it it writes answers as well as a person would do if
        they had a bunch of time.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  Benjamin. You looked at some
        of them today. Did you find the same?\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: And they
        seem much more chatty. And personal. And in a few cases,…\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:
        \ Yeah.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: I thought they gave better. Not answers.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  Yeah, I agree with that too. yeah, the nice thing is, I mean, before
        we had this tension where if we, like let out the slack more and allowed it
        to talk, it would give like Nice sounding answers but they&#39;d be wrong
        too. Often And then we tightened it up and the answers were shorter. Which
        meant that they were, they were not all that wrong. And usually, they were
        right. But they didn&#39;t say as much as ideally they would say now. It seems
        to get that, right? It says more. If there&#39;s more to say it says less,
        if there&#39;s less to say it handles situations where it doesn&#39;t. Want
        to answer pretty well. So all together, really pretty great really, really
        pleased with it.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  I&#39;ll pour it over the others. I
        don&#39;t know if anyone saw what I did, and I didn&#39;t document it on the
        client, but basically I made it so that if in a prompter, you edit, the prompt
        content to be the, the new JSON structure that the Chat GPT messages API expects,
        It&#39;ll just work. So you can do it like the old way, where you just have
        a plain text prompt or you can write it as a JSON file and in the format that&#39;s
        expected. Basically, it tries to parse the the prompter, into JSON, if it
        fails it just passes through the text as it&#39;s and that seems pretty fine.
        So anyways, I did that last night. I&#39;ve got, I&#39;ve got to do the rest
        of the prompts and fidget it with it, but I mean, for the most part I think
        it&#39;s in great shape.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: I think that&#39;s about it.
        Those are my two focus areas are really. My one main one with profit with
        just a little diversion last night.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  Yeah, Cleanser you
        want to go?\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: Okay. And not much to talk about.
        I haven&#39;t made any progress on push notifications yet. Hoping to make
        it today, and Coming Monday.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  So there was this
        bug that Was throwing a script arrow and roll bar. It was very annoying. I
        thought I got all of it on yesterday. By adding a card. So the error is being
        thrown by the JavaScript Google Maps API. And it throws when it throws that
        arrow. If we have Open Info window, it&#39;s called. It&#39;s like when you
        click on a map marker and it shows the and it shows the notification of the,
        if you, if that notification is open, and if you change between routes, Then
        it throws that error. It&#39;s something you do with destroying of the view
        and removing of the listeners at the same time, some kind of a race condition.
        The\\r\\n\\n00:05:00\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  So I try to handle that
        by using Good Old is Route. Active Flag seem to work in the first case that
        we had caught. But on the plan page, if you go if you open up the plan page
        right now and if you go back to the lens list page, Then it still shows that
        error. I mean it is not exactly a big issue but it&#39;s annoying. It&#39;s
        crowding up role at the moment it Just annoying and it has happened recently,
        I not sure. Exactly. What is throwing it. I don&#39;t even think that it&#39;s
        anything. I said that. That was changed. I think it&#39;s probably some Google
        API or something changed from it externally and it&#39;s running error. I&#39;ll
        see what the problem is today. And\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  See if there&#39;s
        some other way to fix it. That was one thing you see.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        My plus one there is that I&#39;m a big fan of making alerts worth looking
        at.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: I…\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  Yes.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: like, there were some reports from listener or listeners from users
        that This is causing trouble at least on that time card screen, right?\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino: It was causing actual trouble. When?\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: But
        I mean, maybe it was coincidental but It seems like error. It seemed like,
        I don&#39;t know, three days ago. There were reports that trouble on a time
        card screen also was the screen.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: Yes. So at least
        on a time card screen,…\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: This was coming from Or one of.\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino: this error has been fixed by my patch. That. Okay. What is on
        the Landscene is still happening? So, And look at that today.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: But ideally we&#39;d have a bit more of a sort of bulletproof. Way
        to wrap it that no matter what&#39;s fine. So I mean We don&#39;t spend more
        time in it,…\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: Yeah.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: but if
        you could find that, that&#39;d be good.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  Yes,
        I know that today. so, I also Worked on the page title Lender. With Amber
        Template. I completed it. Then we found. So initial, I understand to check
        the results of the\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  Of the Linter and it, there
        were some false positives, wherein the page title was present on the parent.
        There was not present on a child, something like that of, that sort. Then
        I have to tweak the paste, title intern a little bit, did that? Now, it&#39;s
        funny. She&#39;s Call. But there are considerable number of pages where. Okay,
        so how many, how many pages do we need to fix a base title for they remember?\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: Okay.\\r\\n\\nAnish Gadekar: Damn you. Not exactly, sure. Like it.\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino:  Okay, definitely I think more than 100, at least.\\r\\n\\nAnish
        Gadekar:  Yeah, it was around 200 something 214 or 84 million.\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino: Okay. So at least the routes. I mean around slash templates are
        highlighted. By the lender. So that seems to be working, okay? Anish will
        finish that work up by. Adding the paste titles in the places that I highlighted.
        For now I&#39;m just made it to spit up a warning instead of an error. And
        after Anish finishes his book, once we have page titles and all of these,
        I let it pages, then I&#39;ll change it to an error. So next time whoever,
        it&#39;s a new route, make sure that you had a page title for it.\\r\\n\\nPankaj
        Kataria: And justice addition. Should we try to handle the pace title via
        application? HbS or like, The most parent route authenticated address, maybe.\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino: Handle in the sense validate him in with this present, or this
        add some thing.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:  I mean. um, this should all be happening
        at one place instead of different templates.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: You.
        Each page has its own title.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Well, I don&#39;t know.
        I mean kind of\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  because it will, then it doesn&#39;t
        have the data until it&#39;s down there, you don&#39;t, I mean,\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino: Like, for example, meeting id. So and so plan ID,…\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: yeah, name of the plan idea or…\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: so and
        so\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: the plan ID, So we don&#39;t, we don&#39;t know, until
        the ultimate childhood is rendered.\\r\\n\\n00:10:00\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:
        \ route.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: What the context is,\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:
        If?\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  I mean, there is a page title service that
        we could use but like Sean said and unless we have the data, we don&#39;t
        always have the right page start to\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria: Okay.\\r\\n\\nColenso
        Castellino:  Yeah, that&#39;s it. From my side.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:
        Pankaj, was next.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Here.\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  Now,
        I was thinking of making Pankaj the captains. He was the first one called
        today.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria: So, I&#39;m continuing on the\\r\\n\\nPankaj
        Kataria:  Board bulk assign form handling more. And real world scenarios over
        here. One of them was Like, and Allowing the option to, you know, retain.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: You.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:  Time zone, existing requirements. When
        there is similar, resource assigned or similar resource classification, assign
        So I read this setting to the form. On.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:  and, This
        isn&#39;t shipped yet. I need some\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria: Style corrections
        on this soil. Ship it today.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Here. That&#39;s a good
        feature.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria: I&#39;m working to.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:
        \ Assign bulk. I mean, crew templates. Where this form? So that will come
        next.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Yes.\\r\\n\\nPankaj Kataria:  and that from,\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  oh, Benjamin.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Hello, okay. so database
        connection issue in terms of it, I Haven&#39;t having a really hard time with
        Heroku. Getting good support on this. Current state is everything that they
        have documented or done is a mess. And I have no plans on making any more
        work in this area until I get better support for them, right? Just probably
        Being very pushy is my goal right now. I just don&#39;t understand. Um, In
        terms of the casting issues, we&#39;ve had, they seem to be resolved by switching
        the cash store that we use.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  We have some backfills
        to do with regards to shift percent tracking. I broke a scope in a refactor
        and accident. Where it was, you&#39;re able to get the driver movement, but
        it wouldn&#39;t update it in certain cases, and I made it never updated. I&#39;ve
        added a regression test for that. I have not looked into what the work is
        needed to backfill it. I don&#39;t know.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  And
        it should be difficult.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  I, i don&#39;t, I had
        a question for Colenso about, Plans and getting the FCM push token work into
        production and on the native apps. If that is, Something that I should keep
        on my mind to. I don&#39;t the other one is about There&#39;s an issue of
        scientific answer right now that I put in the meeting chat, I&#39;m in different
        to who it actually is works on it. But OMG would like to start using the feature
        that I worked on to have a default customer in agreement. Um, being copied,
        when new customers are create. when you customers are created, having the
        rate of grant be copied, From the, from the specified one. I don&#39;t know.
        It probably requires a little bit of UI consideration, but actually interface.
        I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too complicated.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  And
        it&#39;s too much for me at least. So I don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible
        for it.\\r\\n\\n00:15:00\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino: I&#39;ll look at it.
        I need help us all else.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Okay. Yeah, I just if
        you can just even triage and delegate and…\\r\\n\\nColenso Castellino:  Yeah.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer: as long as someone has a hedgehog, I just want to make sure that
        it&#39;s not lost. There&#39;s an interesting issue that&#39;s come up with
        those zynga with regard to split loads when a material when there&#39;s more
        on material transaction on the same trip. That, although we handle the financials
        correctly on the time card level because material transaction exports in the
        invoice, exports is to some extent to hack. I was incorrectly specifying the
        load that the quantity for every material transaction by load is one. and
        I added some logic today to handle that that if there&#39;s the quantity per
        load, is one divided by the number of loads on the trip. So there&#39;s now
        a Attribute on the material transaction in on the server and and the invoice
        data. Which is a trip load count. Essentially.\\r\\n&quot;\"}]}"

        Peckham. Which I think would be have good to have some discussion. Doesn&#39;t,
        I don&#39;t, I know time is precious on this call, so, I&#39;ll just mention
        that the complicated issues that because Pac-Man and Palmer are the same customer
        with the same tech team with two branches. Um, they&#39;ve done the worker
        planning on doing the work to have the one integration endpoint. Return data
        for both branches. And I&#39;m of two minds about that because it makes it
        simple. On the one hand to have one importer that Talks to two branches and
        maybe that&#39;s a behavior tractor. But on the other hand, it&#39;s like
        totally different for everything else and I think it could cause other trouble.
        And just the sort of the confusion about which branch it is. I don&#39;t.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: Hmm, where do you link them? Do you lean towards just having Identical
        separate ones, then.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Yes. I mean, it&#39;s Having.
        Yeah, that that&#39;s certainly the the way things normally work, but I don&#39;t
        know if that&#39;s confusing to them. Like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t just because
        it&#39;s confusing to me, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s confusing to them like\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: I think I&#39;d leaned that way.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  I mean
        because like Kayla or Jim asked Kayla, I do you plan on using the same parameters.
        For this, we&#39;ll just add the sites like I so I don&#39;t know. So I don&#39;t,
        I don&#39;t know. Who is the domain expert on the like, are they, are they
        so similar that we that it&#39;s in our interest to like, we&#39;ll be fighting
        the fighting the stream to treat them as\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  Different
        in this place.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: I mean. I don&#39;t know. It seems like\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  It&#39;s it seems like I&#39;d go with, I mean, if we always if we
        never have the same importer work across branches, that I don&#39;t know that
        I&#39;d start now.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: Okay good. Other open issue.
        Is there&#39;s an open discussion right now at the Palmer. Export that Kalan
        air working on. That&#39;s I think I&#39;ve taken a while to respond to that
        but I think otherwise it&#39;s going well. Same with other various integrations,
        too many dimension. I have one release note pending right now.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: You are.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: I put in the release notes channel
        because they need some help words within it. I think I wrote a terrible release
        note. I think honestly like, I think I covered what I wanted to cover, and
        I, I just If any of you feel like, You want to give it a second look? It&#39;s
        around a feature that I shipped today. That was they come up a few times as
        feature bug, fix, whatever is that I shipped the idea of a job production
        plan. Is flexible and not complete. I would disallow post invoicing changes
        for a number of things. And that has caused trouble for job production plans
        that are still running because they&#39;re they have flexible shifts on them.
        And I wanted to use that as opportunity to also talk about.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  Why we have these validations and I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t
        order things, right, or structure, right?\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: So,
        anyone looks at them,…\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Here. Okay,…\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer: tells me how they use Chat Gpd to fix it up and be happy to.\\r\\n\\n00:20:00\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine: exactly. In doing so now,\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  Yeah, I have
        another release date. I&#39;m going to write after that. One about adding
        Support for accounting for materials, like vendor IDs. And I&#39;m, which
        is also, I think gonna be the same kind of release network. It&#39;s A, If
        you are interested at here&#39;s a thing.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Here.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  And I guess I should probably also write one about split loads.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  Because that&#39;s also something that often we talked about much
        but it&#39;s very interesting.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  That&#39;s yeah,
        I know I just talked for a while and I&#39;m done. It&#39;s hard to believe.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer:  My gosh.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar: I&#39;ll give my update. Of.
        So, last two days, I&#39;ve mostly been working on some bugs and quickies
        and small improvements and stuff. I was supposed to start work on vision importer
        for treatment location events, but I haven&#39;t started with that. Also,
        I was supposed to find a good vector database hosted one, but\\r\\n\\nShirish
        Parsekar:  As I said, I didn&#39;t do anything on that last two days. So I&#39;ll
        continue work on that today.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar:  That&#39;s it. That&#39;s
        all I have.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  Naiya.\\r\\n\\nNaiya Shah: Yes, my update.
        I&#39;m able to complete the time card approval notification thing, but now
        I&#39;m working on the settings to opt out of the time card of pool notification.
        So for that user label and organization settings are done, I&#39;ll currently
        I&#39;m working on the job presentation, plan related settings on it. Um,
        yes. And then after I will look into the My ongoing PR for segment description
        filter in which I have to apply the fuzzy scope. Instagram, the current whatever.
        Yes. That&#39;s it.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Okay, great. Hey Shirish. Hey Shirish.
        And and this may apply to Naiya too, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve taken
        a look into that and benjaminson with you.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  The caching,
        the query related to the Lane summary. I think it&#39;s called the cycle time
        summary. Resource. I don&#39;t remember exactly. I even looked at it since
        I spiked it back when and it&#39;d be really great if we could speed that
        up, I&#39;m not sure. I haven&#39;t really assessed how much work it being\\r\\n\\nShirish
        Parsekar: Yes, I made some adjustment to the query. I used the material transaction,
        turn it somewhere was possible, and the performance is good. Now. so,…\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  oh,\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s, I mean,
        I don&#39;t think we need to cash it urgently for now.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:
        \ oh, that&#39;s good news. I didn&#39;t realize.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar:
        \ Yes, well previously it was taking like six to seven seconds. Around like
        this time of the day, but that has come down to less than one second.\\r\\n\\nShirish
        Parsekar:  That&#39;s a good improvement, I think.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  Oh
        yeah. Yeah, I&#39;m I mean I know that they were like year-to-date. It was
        timing out the other day.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar:  Okay.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:
        \ Yeah. Well, but I mean maybe that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s fixed. Now I&#39;m
        just running it right now.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar: Yeah, I haven&#39;t tried
        out. Inside right out yesterday.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  yeah yeah I just ran
        the year today on Geiger the first time it seems like maybe there&#39;s like
        a like a database cash warming kind of thing that first time I ran it was
        a little slow and then started to go Quick after that and click about a minute
        and or a second and a half for year to date. That&#39;s great there. If you
        don&#39;t mind post back to the that thread. So that because Matt&#39;s been
        bugging about that forever. Need to appreciate that.\\r\\n\\nShirish Parsekar:
        Yeah, I think I did reply to that.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Just meet.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin
        Fleischer: I thought he did too, but it might have been like one of those
        dual threads thing where, like, Dev was crossing from somewhere else and sometimes
        happens.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  Yeah, maybe I just wasn&#39;t paying attention.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  All right. Well, thanks for\\r\\n\\n00:25:00\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:
        Yes, Siris found that like he looked, he picked it up, he looked at it, he
        had an idea and I think I&#39;m gonna say was maybe an hour of work with a
        They looked at that was pretty good attention to turn around.\\r\\n\\nSean
        Devine:  yeah, that&#39;s super\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer:  and also on the
        jump job director playing driver movement, one although I ended up Finishing
        the PR. He started. He found actual problem. So also, like lots of credit
        to shirishan.\\r\\n\\nBenjamin Fleischer: An eye on, like customer facing
        issues. And Getting to their cause.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine: Here. Yeah, great.
        Great job. Yeah, sure. Nice. I see that you posted in use your voice and that
        I just didn&#39;t notice. So thank you. All right, Anish.\\r\\n\\nShirish
        Parsekar: No insurance.\\r\\n\\nAnish Gadekar: So, I added a business unit
        filter on the time card. And now I&#39;ll continue working on the page titles.
        After that, I&#39;ll see if you assign it.\\r\\n\\nSean Devine:  All right.
        Well. I think that&#39;s it for today hopefully over the next three days Mill
        and I will have some pretty good success on the profit stuff coming into Monday.
        And I think we&#39;ll be in a place to demo it all for all the initial parts.
        On Monday&#39;s call. So Anyway. Talk to everyone soon.\\r\\n\\nNaiya Shah:
        Bye-bye.\\r\\n\\nMeeting ended after 00:27:51 \U0001F44B&quot;\"}]}"

        with a transcript creation. So I&#39;m just going to go ahead and get started
        now. There&#39;s been a new app version. Released March 6th. and, so just
        make sure all your drivers have the latest version portable material sites
        can have multiple active locations now,\n\nBrittany Blawn:  so, under your
        material site, Under this portable site section. You can click Make Portable.
        You can have multiple portable locations at the same time that are productive
        with one of them being active, so that you can stockpile materials at a non-productive
        location in preparation to make that the productive location. You can only
        have one productive at a time.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  There&#39;s a video release
        note for newsletters. It goes through all the features of the newsletters
        and how to create them and our Kayla feature pulls from newsletters. So if
        Banks wants to create some newsletters for Banks people. Hey Kayla will pull
        from those newsletters when people at Banks search through. Hey Kayla. So
        you could create content for your own users for Hey Kayla to reference. So
        that&#39;s a really useful feature. If you want to start creating your own
        newsletters, the Material summary and Job Summary reports. Now have a Dynamic
        Date window. So hmm.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  These are the reports that you can
        create in them bookmark and now you can use this offset from Today. Drop Down
        menu. And bookmark, the page after you&#39;ve created it and each time you
        come back to it, it will update on the date range based off of today so I&#39;d
        like a two-week, look, back period or, you know, a one-month look, back period,
        instead of a fixed date range. So it just makes it easier to keep viewing
        your updated reports.\n\n00:05:00\n\nBrittany Blawn:  The board has a bulk,
        a sign, labor and equipment feature now. so, on the board, Click this book
        action and it allows you to bulk assign. Labor or equipment. To make that
        faster. We&#39;ve improved Hey, Kayla. She&#39;s faster and more accurate
        and we&#39;re continuing to add content from our side to make her even more
        accurate, and we&#39;ll continue to improve her as time goes on.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: And in this last feature is the reason that I&#39;m recording. We now
        have automated summaries for meetings, transcripts. So I created an xbe meeting
        and…\n\nMatt Lerner: Six.\n\nBrittany Blawn: I made Savannah and Kenny attendees.
        This is the link to our agenda. I&#39;m recording the meeting and it&#39;s
        going to create a transcript, Google meet creates a transcript for me. I&#39;m
        gonna copy and paste that into here and it will automatically generate a summary
        of our meeting for us. It&#39;s not 100% perfect, but it&#39;s really close,
        it&#39;s really good. So if you wanted to be, you know, beautiful go in and
        just adjust it a little bit, just review what it says, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s
        pretty spot on and a real time saver so you can go back and check this out
        after our meetings over. I think it takes a few minutes for the transcript
        and recording to catch up, but when that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll paste that in
        there. And that is it for platform updates.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: oh, I have
        some introduced to you. Is this Keisha, she&#39;s our new discomfort. Hi.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn:  Right.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  Welcome.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Yeah. It&#39;s
        what I&#39;m gonna change the video.\n\nMatt Lerner: It&#39;s good. Good luck.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: We can see it. If?\n\nMatt Lerner: Working with that group.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: One thing. So, going back to the The Hey, Kayla and newsletters specific
        to banks. One thing I thought about this, when I was talking to Brent the
        other day was putting like, you know, like, when the PMS are putting in the
        backlog jobs, there&#39;s certain, you know, things we want them putting in,
        and not so it&#39;d be cool to put like a. Here&#39;s how to put a backlog
        plan in, in as a newsletter. So then when they search, like, How do I put
        a backlog plan and it pulls up your guys&#39;s sop for that. Or like How do
        I change the specific mix design so like you can start putting in banks is
        like SOPs around that.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: So then
        when they ask for help it pulls up your guys&#39;s specific processes as well
        like in addition to like our our newsletters.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Oh cool.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: But it could be Banks specific stuff.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Yeah.
        Can you have screenshots and newsletters?\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yes.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Okay, so the kitties made a couple like how to documents or superintendents
        about how to create a plan, I think. So wonder if you decided to a newsletter.\n\nMatt
        Lerner:  Yeah, I think adding images is a little tricky because it you kind
        of have to do it in the markdown format. Which which I&#39;m not super first
        in. So maybe it&#39;s just a user user issue on my part. But but I know you
        can add images to there as well.\n\nMatt Lerner:  And or like links to videos,
        you know, things like that.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: and, One thing I wanted
        to ask you about it,…\n\nMatt Lerner:  so, that was one thing I thought of\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: so on the board it was the board. Any plans for the next three weeks.
        Really has two weeks now, we&#39;re already into the first week but Whenever
        we look at the board, it was great. It looks very similar to our schedule
        on Google Drive, but I think it was just a coincidence that the cruise. Were
        to not making anything so those are the schedule. So for example, the Blue
        crew is staying on the same job, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday and
        Friday. They&#39;re moving to a second job. So it was a coincidence. I think
        that those two jobs were in adjacent rows on the schedule. So it&#39;s, you
        can see the blue crew all at once you see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
        then go down a row and then you see Thursday and Friday, but I feel like at
        some point\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  the job they&#39;re going to wouldn&#39;t
        necessarily be in an adjacent roof so you can have to search for. Where&#39;s
        the Blue planet? I&#39;m wondering the filter you might be best if I share
        my screen.\n\n00:10:00\n\nMatt Lerner: Hit. Yeah, I think I know what you&#39;re
        talking about.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  I don&#39;t know.\n\nBrittany Blawn:
        You.\n\nMatt Lerner: just,\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Business form.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  See. Here, this is it.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Just so happens.
        The Blue Cruise, two jobs are back to back but What it wasn&#39;t. Is there
        a way that we could get it all seem? Like, just well, I guess you don&#39;t
        have to filter just to that one crew.\n\nMatt Lerner: Yeah, click that little
        filter in the top right.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  So you have to do it crew
        by crew. There&#39;s no way to make it. look like, This, where you\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Sort sort by crew, not filter by three.\n\nMatt Lerner: So, go
        back to the board. So essentially you&#39;d Be able to. I guess.\n\nMatt Lerner:  So,
        that&#39;s filtering. So you&#39;d want to just Sort by.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        You know, just sourcing is all but you see the blue crews entire week without
        having to scroll?\n\nBrittany Blawn: Common.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: I know
        that&#39;s picky, but I was just my first impression.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah,
        no, I understand it.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  I had another question. Oh. It
        doesn&#39;t it seems like it&#39;s gone now. But at the time, Error projects
        showing up on here that didn&#39;t have plans. I was wondering why that was
        but seems like that&#39;s sorted itself out.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Here.
        Yeah. We\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  I think one of my\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Mother.
        Okay, so just we were talking made me think so. You went over with PMS how
        to put on those backlog. Your projects. I wasn&#39;t in in that meeting but
        I believe that I&#39;m kind of starting to do that at least for the next week
        and Plan on two weeks and three weeks in advance. It, is it anything different
        from just making a plan with one segment that It does all of the materials.
        Is there a way to? Make it easier to edit for the. superintendents, once that,
        you know, they comes\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Because right now, I&#39;m putting
        it is.\n\nBrittany Blawn: It.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: So last week I put in
        and this week&#39;s, Asphalts good. So far all of the superintendents are
        making another plan. Because that&#39;s just kind of how they usually do it.
        They&#39;ll duplicate their plan from the night before.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Is
        there any way to\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Not necessarily make a plan to have
        it just as a kind of like this is a forecast plan, I guess extremely generic.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: Yeah, so when you&#39;re I mean, it just comes down to how many details
        you put in your plan, right? So kind of the purpose of putting the backlog
        plans in, is you just kind of put in like called the bare bones or the bear
        information required like to save a plan essentially. And I&#39;ll send you
        the little guide that we shared with them on kind…\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Yeah.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: what those fields are. But yeah basically you&#39;re just putting
        in the very basic information.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Okay.\n\nMatt Lerner:
        Just so when you pull up the schedule you have some you know rough idea of
        the type of work that&#39;s going on, you know, quantities truck count, you
        know like crew and equipment requirements that sort of thing.\n\nMatt Lerner:
        And and…\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: then so I guess like
        is the issue that they&#39;re creating their own plans or you just want something
        in there for forecasting for the next couple weeks. And then whether they
        create the plan or just use yours and tweak it, you know, you know, you know,
        it doesn&#39;t matter to you.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Hey really we&#39;re
        it doesn&#39;t matter to me. We&#39;re still just gonna work. Working out
        what&#39;s gonna flow best for us right now. The reason we&#39;re doing it
        is to show plants, you know, the material, demand forecast.\n\n00:15:00\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: um, the only thing that we were thinking is if they do start what
        one? Changing or editing plans can get a little tricky unless you&#39;re in
        XP every day. And asking the superintendents to do. It was if you for us and
        then if they do or if we do say Just cancel one night shift everything over
        on I-26 on Sundays we get less time. Yeah last time so the start times you&#39;re
        different and to create plan the start times or you know required.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Well. Actually don&#39;t let the required, but it&#39;s really
        difficult. If you make a plan without being such, I want to totally in order
        to go back and start time. Yeah, I just know it&#39;s a lot of room for error
        whenever We? make the plan and then something when something inevitably changes
        I guess a huge burden and maintaining the integrity of those planes.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: If?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  but really, And our decision. Where the
        ball is and Johnny support. It&#39;s figuring out, do we abandon the Google
        Drive schedule, and go fully into Xpe or Doing not scheduled. So I don&#39;t
        think we can do both just a lot of room for error like conflicting information.\n&quot;"}]}'

        I mean, yeah. And that&#39;s the, the purpose for the week out, two weeks,
        plus, you know, month, whatever you want to call it. Consider your backlog
        is putting those bare bones plans in and it&#39;s literally just, you know,
        placeholders. So, you have an a rough idea. And then,…\n\nBrittany Blawn:
        Up.\n\nMatt Lerner: you know, whether it&#39;s two, three days, prior 48 hours,
        is when you put the fine details in, Just like they&#39;re doing now, so they&#39;re
        building the plan for the next day, the next day, right? So that&#39;s how
        you currently do it. So the next step would be like to put in those Bare bones
        plans.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: If you will just as, like,
        placeholders again with the three main forecasting tools, so, material forecasting
        trucking, and then your crew and equipment forecasting,\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        Just think, eventually we&#39;ll have to. kind of get them more indexed and
        I&#39;m not sure or…\n\nMatt Lerner: It. Yeah,…\n\nSavannah Hathaway: just
        three hours how\n\nMatt Lerner: and it&#39;s So have the PM stopped putting
        in the backlog and like now you guys are starting to do that or what&#39;s
        the? Where&#39;s that come full circle at? Yeah.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: I&#39;m
        not really sure. A little bit now, but I think the biggest the biggest pain
        trying to edit plans,…\n\nMatt Lerner:  Okay.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: like,
        for the superintendents is changing the material types. They really struggle
        getting. Of an old material type off of the plan. Usually, because it&#39;s
        either, it&#39;s still attached to the segments and they try to delete it.
        It won&#39;t let them. Feel. This has got a damn pat now he can do it. But
        then sometimes we switch plants,…\n\nBrittany Blawn: If?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        then the old material site so on there, so it won&#39;t let them delete.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  I don&#39;t really want to delete material type because it makes
        the materials start site unknown. For those kinds of errors, they&#39;re the
        biggest hurdles for our superintendents.\n\nMatt Lerner: Okay, would like
        a short video on,…\n\nSavannah Hathaway: let&#39;s,\n\nMatt Lerner: like the
        best way to do that, help. Do you think or What do you?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Yeah,
        maybe it hurts. I struggles sometimes with the default turkey and start state
        so but it messes me up, too.\n\nMatt Lerner: so, like…\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  but,\n\nMatt
        Lerner: if that&#39;s set for Charleston and then for some reason you need
        to switch to Somerville, you know, like you go in, do the material swap but
        then you get errors about the start site being Different or something of that
        nature.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: get creative shift and it says or like even
        just turning materials off, You know, they dislocated a plan from yesterday
        that needed you. Know 57 stone or whatever. And you just turn the materials
        off and then you go to create a shift and it says, You…\n\nBrittany Blawn:  Up.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: it&#39;s expected material site or something. Like, No, we don&#39;t
        want it. There&#39;s a lot of things that for us, we&#39;re able to just click
        around a good bit and get it to work, because we&#39;ve seen it so many times.
        But yeah, the rpms are very are whatever. It&#39;s not working. We&#39;re
        still going to do the work anyway and then record keeping after that. It&#39;s
        Of difficult. You. I just think they need it. If they run into any hiccup
        builder, they&#39;re just gonna be like you Know whatever we&#39;re going
        to do or yeah. And we can only do it…\n\n00:20:00\n\nBrittany Blawn: Up.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: because we live in it. So I know that&#39;s that comes with time.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: Yeah, well, I mean they&#39;re in the field on a job on an iPad too.
        So like sure there&#39;s there&#39;s variables that are not that,…\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: you know, aren&#39;t the most efficient.
        So we just got to figure out how to overcome that hurdle.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        I think one thing could be. I turned on the requires driving minutes and material
        site matters features. It&#39;s really messed up a lot of people just they
        can&#39;t find it someone who they can. Add more texts to that error message
        say. This can be found in the planning section of the plan and the Plan Attitude
        page, something like that. Well. Yeah,…\n\nMatt Lerner: Yeah, a little more
        direction instead of Yeah,…\n\nSavannah Hathaway: where to put it.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: that&#39;s that&#39;s good feedback. Are you did you make a note of
        that? I guess you&#39;re the transcript,…\n\nBrittany Blawn: Yes. Yeah,…\n\nMatt
        Lerner: don&#39;t we?\n\nBrittany Blawn: I know I&#39;ve been\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: Action items and everything. So,\n\nSavannah Hathaway: It will separate
        actions.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: do you have to clearly
        say it like\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Action. I know.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  I&#39;m
        not sure, actually, I don&#39;t think.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Brittany will put
        a feature request in for better air, notification messages.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Highlight
        this. And now,\n\nMatt Lerner:  But yeah that&#39;s a pretty simple thing
        for us to add is a little more words or verbs around that.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  But
        I do think that. No huge action items on that. We&#39;re just really, we&#39;re
        trying to work through what our best process is gonna be. So\n\nMatt Lerner:
        Okay. Whilst?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  But I did it to. Yeah, good.\n\nMatt
        Lerner:  Was to say, I&#39;ll send over that what I shared with them as a
        just you have it as reference and a starting point but more than happy to
        help you guys troubleshoot that process or whatever&#39;s needed.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: Up.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Sounds good. So I did have two that, you
        know, I&#39;ve written down the other day.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Either last
        week week before, Savannah wasn&#39;t here. And she asked How to? Reopen a
        pre-approval or like take the pre-approval away. So actually saw the process
        that she did and you know, she did deleted the time card but then it says
        that you know, pre-approval still exist or pre-approval exist but no time
        card exists or something like that. You just\n\nMatt Lerner: Did you?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: Did you cancel the auto submission prior
        to deleting the time card?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Oh so whenever you well
        that&#39;s what I was thinking as well. So I would maybe financial sections,
        click on actions and at that point, all it says is submit. There&#39;s no
        cancel on approve or or anything like that. Click on the time. So like look
        Wednesday.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Was an argument.\n\nBrittany Blawn: Up.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: Yeah, so let&#39;s find out.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Some.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Intermission. Presentation.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  All right, so
        tell it, let&#39;s find out this job this morning. I go here.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Oh, cancel all the banks mission drive the top. What do you know?
        Right in front of us? There&#39;s so many words. I just get in the rhythm
        and it delete boom, move on. Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: Yeah, go back to the job
        plan, if you will. To the Financial section. because I think if you try clicking
        actions,\n\nMatt Lerner:  does it say anything? Okay, so just as auto submission
        scheduled And then scroll a little bit back up or close that. And then click
        on Edit, pre-approval. I just want to see what that screen brings up.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: Senate.\n\nMatt Lerner: Okay, so there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s just
        added in the, okay? So you have to click into the time card to see it or…\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: so, Automatic conditions well and…\n\nMatt Lerner: do it.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: then delete the time card. Works.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah.\n\nMatt
        Lerner:  and I&#39;ll make sure that that&#39;s like, because I feel like
        if you delete the time card, it should, Remove the pre-approval Automax emission,
        but I&#39;ll make sure that that&#39;s the intended flow on that.\n\n00:25:00\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: I feel it might because there is a little tiny text box that pops
        up whenever you delete the time code it does warn you approval still exists.
        So I thought there&#39;s there&#39;s some customer that has a use case for
        that. but, Staring me in the face.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        Thank you.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  And then last week
        I&#39;d asked if there was some sort of supporting document that, you know,
        would back up our invoices was into customers and he had said that time card
        details or something like that and you gave me example and that&#39;s pretty
        much what our invoices look like it or have that data on it, so, Area suggest
        to give them access. I was hoping that you&#39;d be able to masquerade as
        one of our customers that we do give access to so that we can see what they
        see. Because we don&#39;t necessarily want them to see everything.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: See the e-ticketing?\n\nMatt Lerner: Well, they want more of the time
        card details. So when they get the invoice,…\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Yeah.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: it&#39;s like eight hours that, you know, hundred bucks an hour for
        800, but they want to see Was it 8 am to 4 pm or seven a, you know?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: even more than that,…\n\nMatt Lerner: I mean the\n\nSavannah Hathaway:
        they just You know, because I sent them, you know, start time and time total
        hours, pretty much all of their trucks and I even took screenshots of the
        line GPS graph.\n\nMatt Lerner:  right.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  It, their questioning,
        the GPS, crap. How do we know that? The top lines actually Summerville playing
        at the bottom line is actually our job. So it is at the justice but it would
        give them access and exped and they were clearly see that. The materials that
        you said is the plant, the job site says, their job site and then they see
        the truck paying back and forth along with the associated tickets that came
        from the plant.\n\nMatt Lerner: Yeah, what&#39;s one of the what&#39;s Proper.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: so, our Garrett Stevenson is the proper paving and he does have
        access So,…\n\nMatt Lerner:  Okay.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: my biggest concern
        is that they would see it. On the financials. Section How far right? It&#39;ll
        give you the dollar amount and we have a different trucker.\n\nMatt Lerner:
        Yeah, it would. You. They would only see the customer amount.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: We do a customer and wasn&#39;t which they see Okay, I see the trigger
        around.\n\nMatt Lerner: Right? Because you&#39;re a branch broker member.
        So you see the trucker and the customer if they&#39;re accustomed,…\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Okay.\n\nMatt Lerner: only a customer and then the trucker only
        sees the trucker side. So okay, so Garrett\n\nMatt Lerner:  Actually.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Hey buddy, what&#39;s up? They&#39;re going like this year, right?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: You. Know.\n\nMatt Lerner:  All right, can you see that?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: Oh yes.\n\nBrittany Blawn: It.\n\nMatt Lerner:  There we go. All
        right. So I&#39;m gonna\n\nMatt Lerner: Masquerade is Garrett. So this would
        be his browse page. This would be his You…\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  See, we
        want to go to the\n\nMatt Lerner: set. Say it again.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  We
        want to see his plans.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah. So this is the developers like
        where the e-ticketing would live and then this would be where the actual plans
        are Is there a job today?\n\nSavannah Hathaway: No. We&#39;ve been under release
        paving on our job, so we set it up in the paving customer.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  It&#39;s
        been a while. I know we could Paragon is painting for us tomorrow. So, I know
        we can set it up in their customer but then set it to the project. If I don&#39;t
        really want to Do that. I might confuse death. Do it though. Then we&#39;re
        doing.\n\nMatt Lerner: Do you know the last day that there was a job under
        here? Potentially.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  um,\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  It&#39;s
        about.\n\nMatt Lerner:  I want to show you the time card management which
        is where they could see all the details. Pretty clearly.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Right.
        24th. In the third or 24th of February.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Nope. Maybe
        the 17th.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Oh wait, I&#39;m on all plans. That might be the
        issue.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Right. 17. And Friday.\n\nMatt Lerner: There
        we go. So they could come into,…\n\nBrittany Blawn: Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner:
        you know, just like you guys use time card management. So these would be their
        three.\n\n00:30:00\n\nBrittany Blawn:  Sure.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  I like,\n\nMatt
        Lerner: So, they would see like this data. and then,…\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  The
        cause. Three. Not.\n\nMatt Lerner: That might be it depends on if he I didn&#39;t
        check to see if he&#39;s a manager or an ops user. Under proper.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  oh,\n\nMatt Lerner: So if he&#39;s an ops user, this, it&#39;s
        like blanked out. So you would just see the total hours.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  okay.\n\nMatt
        Lerner:  But let me like, so here&#39;s he can come into the plan, right?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  That was the last.\n\nMatt Lerner:  You know, and see the Material
        Site job site.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: Like us to stay groups fast. That&#39;s
        the banks. Just\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  so that only after that, can they at
        a time card? Because it&#39;s under their names.\n\nMatt Lerner: Can can they
        can they what?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Can they edit time card? Because I just
        see the link there.\n&quot;"}]}'

        operations.\n\nMatt Lerner: Yeah, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I can&#39;t tell
        if like the masqueradian&#39;s not accurate or or what so we&#39;re working

        in that Brittany.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  There.\n\nBrittany Blawn: It up now.\n\nMatt
        Lerner: because yeah, you wouldn&#39;t have any my plans\n\nSavannah Hathaway:

        state of.\n\nBrittany Blawn: The managers.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: S. And I
        wish.\n\nBrittany Blawn: Can see the time cards. And so can operations. Managers
        can generate invoices. reports operations cannot\n\nMatt Lerner: So you can
        see the time cards as a ops.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  he can see them. Yeah.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s fine. Yeah, we want to see a tampers.\n\nBrittany
        Blawn:  It doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s any difference for time Card.
        Between manager and operations.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: So operations can still
        edit the time for now, so there&#39;s no difference. Of. Course, reviewing
        them.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  Review.\n\nSavannah Hathaway: I thought that you
        had a time card, approve it if you&#39;re not a manager user then you have
        to be listed explicitly as a time put approver on that JPP in order to Or
        anywhere.\n\nMatt Lerner: Right.\n\nBrittany Blawn:  The right. The viewing.
        They can both see everything.\n\nMatt Lerner: If?\n\nBrittany Blawn: Time
        card management managers can\n\nBrittany Blawn:  See, the time cards.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: What you&#39;re\n\nBrittany Blawn: Updates.\n\nMatt Lerner: So it
        sounds like you can see the time cards whether he&#39;s in Manager or Ops.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Expensive candidate and that&#39;s that&#39;s good offseasoners.
        Yeah. I think so. And so what they&#39;re looking at.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  That&#39;s
        good.\n\nMatt Lerner: If?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  You make them we do or do
        not need to make them subscribers.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Okay, so you can&#39;t
        look at driver days, either. Brittany. As an ops user.\n\nMatt Lerner:  I&#39;m
        sorry, was that Savannah?\n\nSavannah Hathaway: And we do or do not need to
        make them job plan subscribers.\n\nMatt Lerner:  I think you do. In order
        for them to view the job, otherwise I get this little red air that shows up
        the plane cannot be found.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Okay.\n\nMatt Lerner:  It&#39;s
        like when I try and click into here as an ops user. I get this.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: Bring chocolate rock.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Plan not found.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway:  Even they it just pulled it out.\n\nMatt Lerner:  Yeah, that&#39;s
        why I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a masking issue or not because nothing else
        is loading here.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  The tickets from the plant.\n\nMatt
        Lerner:  Right.\n\nMatt Lerner:  yeah, just keeps like Loading and loading.\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: Hear personal come over and…\n\nBrittany Blawn: If?\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: give me those. Yeah, commercial sure levels. Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner:
        Oh, yeah, well I can&#39;t even edit memberships or add people. That&#39;s
        enough user.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  So, all right.\n\nMatt Lerner: yes, it
        sounds like opposite is probably the at least way to start and…\n\nBrittany
        Blawn: If?\n\nMatt Lerner: then as Adam as a default subscriber,\n\nSavannah
        Hathaway: Okay. Well, this is\n\nMatt Lerner: Do you want me to do that? While
        I&#39;m in here?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  But you. Should probably remember
        so this is Jared. He he&#39;s fine being you know manner. Yeah well I guess.
        It&#39;s fine. Okay.\n\n00:40:00\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Turn on the unmanaged

        think we really was. Yeah.\n\nMatt Lerner: All right.\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  Yeah,

        Hathaway:  Giving us any email address?\n\nSavannah Hathaway:  And every slightly
        good on it. Okay more. So yeah but any any problems that we run into just
